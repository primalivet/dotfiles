  ; A short notice what is actually being executed here:
  ; nvim -d opens neovim in diffmode.
  ;
  ; -c "wincmd l" executes <C-w>l to move the focus to the next split to the
  ; right.
  ;
  ; -c "norm ]c" puts the cursor inside the split to the first change. It is the
  ; equivalent of hitting ]c in command mode which is indicated by norm. Command
  ; mode is also known as normal mode in vim.
