# HINT: All options below are Windows (WSL presumed) exclusive
# ---
# As of now it doesn't seem to be a way to conditionally set options depending
# on platform
#
# So on Windows, copy this file to
# `/mnt/c/Users/[username]/AppData/Roaming/alacritty/` and uncomment the lines
# below.

# Below you want to set the specific name of the WSL Linux distribution you
# want to start in `shell.program` and the directory you want to start in in
# `working_directory`. Both for the shell.program and for the working_directory

# shell:
#  program: "C:\\Windows\\System32\\wsl.exe -d Ubuntu-22.04"

# working_directory: "//wsl$/Ubuntu-22.04/home/primalivet"
